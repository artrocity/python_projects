Questions, Answers
"What is the purpose of a pointer", "It allows you to store an address in memory"
"What is an abstract data type", ""
"What is a queue", "A queue is a (FIFO) first in first out Data Structure"
"What are the 2 functions of a queue", "enqueue - adding to the end, dequeue - taking the first item in line"
"What is a stack","A stack is a (LIFO) last in first out abstract data structure"
"What are the operations for a stack", "Push - Adding to the top of stack, Pop - Remove from the top"
"What is an array", "A chunk of memory where items are stored back to back to back"
"What is the primary advantage of a linked list over an array?", "Dynamic size"
"How can you find the middle of a linked list in a single pass?", "Using two pointers technique, one advancing two steps at a time (fast pointer), and the other one step at a time (slow pointer)."
"What data structure would you use to implement a stack?", "Linked List or Array"
"How do you reverse a linked list?", "Using iterative method or recursive method"
"Which sorting algorithm has the best worst-case runtime?", "Merge sort and heapsort have O(n log n) worst-case runtime."
"What is the main difference between a queue and a stack?", "Queue uses FIFO (First In First Out) and Stack uses LIFO (Last In First Out) principles."
"What is the time complexity of accessing an element in a hash table?", "O(1) on average"
"In tree traversal, which traversal visits the left subtree, then the root, then the right subtree?", "In-order traversal"
"What data structure is used in a breadth-first search of a graph?", "Queue"
"What is the primary use of a binary heap?", "As a priority queue"
"How is a bubble sort algorithm implemented?", "By repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order."
"What is the difference between a breadth-first search and a depth-first search?", "BFS explores all nodes at the present depth before moving to nodes at the next depth level, while DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking."
"How does the quicksort algorithm work?", "It works by selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot."
"What is a balanced binary search tree?", "A binary search tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than 1."
"Why are AVL trees important?", "They are self-balancing binary search trees, ensuring O(log n) lookup and insertion times."
"What is a hash collision and how is it handled?", "Occurs when two different keys hash to the same index in an array. It can be handled by chaining or open addressing."
"How does Dijkstra's algorithm work?", "It finds the shortest path from a source vertex to all vertices in a weighted graph."
"What is dynamic programming?", "A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems."
"How can you determine if a linked list has a cycle using O(1) space?", "Using Floydâ€™s Cycle detection algorithm or two-pointer technique."
"What is the difference between 'best', 'average', and 'worst' case time complexities?", "Best is the optimal case, average is the expected case for random input, and worst is the most inefficient case."
"What is a trie used for?", "Storing a dynamic set of strings, often used in search engines for predictive text."
"What is a red-black tree?", "A type of self-balancing binary search tree."
"How does the bellman-ford algorithm differ from Dijkstra's?", "Bellman-Ford works with graphs that have negative weight edges, whereas Dijkstra's does not."
"What is a post-order tree traversal?", "Visits the left subtree, then the right subtree, and then the root."
"What is an adjacency matrix?", "A square matrix used to represent a finite graph, indicating whether pairs of vertices are adjacent."
"Why is the BFS algorithm ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph?", "Because it explores nodes layer by layer, ensuring the shortest path is found before any longer paths."
"What is a k-d tree used for?", "Partitioning space for nearest neighbor search algorithms in multidimensional space."
"What is the time complexity of inserting an element into a binary search tree?", "O(log n) for a balanced tree but can be O(n) in the worst case for a skewed tree."
"How are prefix sums useful in algorithms?", "They allow for constant-time look-up for the sum of elements in a range."
"Which data structure can be used to find the highest element in a window of an array?", "A deque (double-ended queue) can efficiently track the maximum in a sliding window."
